## Session Log

### Session 2026-02-04 – Verification / Resume

**Started at**: Phase 5, Verification  
**Context**: Flow status already COMPLETED; implementation present. Implementation log was still template.

#### Completed
- Confirmed all plan items implemented:
  - `l10n.yaml`, `lib/l10n/` with `app_*.arb` and generated `AppLocalizations`
  - `LocaleProvider` and `LanguageConstants` in `lib/core/localization/`
  - `main.dart`: `LocaleProvider` created, `loadSavedLocale()` on startup, provider in tree, `MaterialApp.router` uses `locale`, `localizationsDelegates`, `supportedLocales`
  - Profile screen: "Language" list tile, modal bottom sheet with language list and native names, persistence via `LocaleProvider.setLocale`
- Filled implementation log and marked plan checkboxes complete.

#### Deviations from Plan
- None. Structure matches spec (ARB in `lib/l10n`, `arb-dir` in `l10n.yaml` points to `lib/l10n`).

#### Discoveries
- One Profile list tile still uses hardcoded "Expert Profile Switcher" / "Roles: ..."; could use `l10n.switchProfile` / `l10n.roles` in a follow-up if desired.

**Ended at**: Phase 5 complete  
**Handoff notes**: Flow complete. Optional: localize remaining Profile strings; expand ARB coverage to onboarding/swipe/annotation per requirements.
